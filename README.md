# Embedded C for Microcontrollers (ECM) Project 
## IR Bomb Defuser

This project was part of the ME3 ECM course where groups of pairs were taught how to programme a PicKit3 Microcontroller using C within the MPLab IDE. Groups were given various components such as an IR sensor, LCD screen and Robot Base. 

They were then tasked to programme the robot such that it could locate an IR beacon, read the RFID tag's code present at the beacon's location, return to it's initial position whilst displaying the RFID code to the user on the LCD screen. Finally the groups then presented the main features of their codebase within a 10 minute presentation.

## What I learnt
- Introduction to the nuances of the C language such as pointers, memory management etc.
- How to break down a large project into smaller actionable tasks 
- The importance of modularising code, and creating well defined functions
- Clean Code production
- How to debug not only code, but issues with electrical components
- How to get to grips with a component's datasheet and incorporate unfamiliar components independently
- How to account for hardware issues such as debouncing and weak motors via software adjustments
- Being able to present the code and explain the different features within it and justify our decisions to those unfamiliar with the codebase

Note: I also realised how much of a pain manual version control is (Evident in the long name of the final project FinalProjectCleanSmoothComplete.c), but didn't know any better at the time since it was the first relatively large project I'd ever completed ^_^.
